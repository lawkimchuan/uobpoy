                    <p><span class="bold">Space Odyssey</span><br/>Stefanie Hauger, (b.1969, Germany)<br /><br />Acrylic on Canvas<br/>170.0 x 170.0 cm</p>
                    <p>Ms Hauger's contemporary interpretation of a mandala, a concentric circular diagram which helps focus attention during meditation, shows an abstract representation of a healthy planet as seen from space. By meditating on the health of the planet, the artist hopes that the viewer's subconscious becomes invigorated by the fresh cool colours and the absence of heat. Ms Hauger says that our current planet is being destroyed and she hopes that her interpretation of a healthy planet will instill in the audience a desire to care for the planet and repair the damage being done.</p>
                    <p>From a young age, Ms Hauger has spent been immersed in the world of art and design. Her mother was a successful photographer and painter and Ms Hauger spent her childhood accompanying her mother to art exhibitions. Her father was an avid collector of art and antiques and she has a sister who is currently a Doctor of Art History. Following her training in interior architecture in the UK, Ms Hauger arrived in Singapore at the age of 24. After a long career in interior design, Ms Hauger decided to pursue her dreams and became a full-time artist in 2011.</p>
