							<h4 class="text-left bold">Going back in time: The history of UOB Painting of the Year</h4>

                                <p>The year was 1982 and it was a time when the contemporary art scene was flourishing in Singapore. Driven by a passion to encourage aspiring artists in the pursuit of their craft, United Overseas Bank (UOB) started its annual Painting of the Year competition in Singapore.</p>
								<p>Thirty-two years on, the UOB Painting of the Year competition is now the longest-running art competition in Singapore and one of the most prominent in the region. It has helped to discover many emerging artists and recognised several established professionals who have contributed significantly to the development of the Southeast Asian arts scene.</p>
								<p>For many emerging artists, winning the competition has drawn attention to their talents and encouraged them to pursue art as a career. One such artist who was discovered by the UOB Painting of the Year is <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-1" data-type="inline">Mr Gong Yao Min.</a> When he won the competition in 2002 for his work<span class="italic">The Impression of Singapore, Series Three, Colour Space,</span> he memorably said that winning brought him precious time to paint and hone his craft.</p>
								<p>Indeed, the time proved fruitful for the artist. Mr Gong went on to claim the UOB Painting of the Year title yet again in <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-2" data-type="inline">2011</a> for <span class="italic">My Dream Land</span> which showcased a more defined style and breath-taking technique. He continues to draw praise for his use of traditional Chinese ink techniques to depict modern subjects.</p>
                                <p>The only other double UOB Painting of the Year winner, Ms Kit Tan Juat Lee, continues to be well-regarded for her paintings which explore contemporary Asian identities. Her signature style of immaculate painting, vivid colours and graphic sensibilities are what make both her winning paintings, 1997’s <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-3" data-type="inline"><span class="italic">Endless Love</span></a> and 2004 ‘s <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-4" data-type="inline"><span class="italic">The World Of Xi You Ji,</span></a>favourites with audiences.</p>

                                <p>The UOB Painting of the Year alumni itself includes many artists who are now considered national treasures in Singapore. Among these include one of Singapore’s masters of modern art - <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-5" data-type="inline">Mr Goh Beng Kwan.</a> His winning artwork in the inaugural 1982 competition, the evocative and lyrical collage, The Dune, was inspired by his time in Provincetown, Massachusetts where he studied his craft. Following his win, Mr Goh went on to make his mark in the world of abstract painting and was awarded the Singapore Cultural Medallion in 1989.</p>
                                <p>Other well-known recipients include <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-6" data-type="inline">Mr Anthony Poon,</a> the 1983 POY winner and one of the pioneer abstract artists of Singapore, as well as 1991 winner <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-7" data-type="inline">Mr Chua Ek Kay</a> who is famed for his contemporary Chinese ink paintings. Both artists were conferred the Singapore Cultural Medallion in 1990 and 1999 respectively.</p>
                                <p>Between 2011 and 2012, UOB broadened the Painting of the Year competition to include artists from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, drawing fresh ideas and passion to the competition’s talent pool. In 2012, Indonesian artist Mr <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-8" data-type="inline">Y. Indra Wahyu</a> took home the Grand Regional Award prize for his piece depicting a school choir, <span class="italic">School Hymns,</span> which honoured the role of schools in imparting knowledge and creating a harmonious society.</p>

                                <p>The 2012 competition also identified emerging talents such as Malaysia’s <a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-9" data-type="inline">Mr Mohd Azri bin Abdullah</a> and Thailand’s<a class="portfolio-thumb" href="#inline-past-10" data-type="inline"> Mr Aimrom Yunu,</a> who were both awarded the UOB Painting of the Year prizes in their respective countries. Mr Mohd Azri intrigued judges with his interpretation of the shadowy world of the illegal money lender in the charcoal and bitumen painting Ah Long. Mr Yunu meanwhile, touched the heart with a magnificent portrait of his beloved grandmother which expressed the strong religious values and belief in goodness that she imparted to him.</p>
                                <p>A space is now reserved in the UOB Painting of the Year Gallery for artists who can inspire us with their vision.</p>

                        	<p><img src="images/featured/stefanie-hauger.jpg" alt="Inspired by: Stefanie Hauger" /></p>
                            <p>Ms Stefanie Hauger is the winner of the 2013 UOB Southeast Asian and Singapore Painting of the Year Awards. Her love for the arts began at an early age as she accompanied her parents to art exhibitions and museums. Her mother is an artist and photographer and her father was an avid collector of art and antiques. </p>
                            <p>Ms Hauger became a full time artist in 2011 and has since shown her sculptures and paintings at several exhibitions in Singapore.</p>
                            <p>The UOB Painting of the Year team caught up with Ms Hauger in her art studio to find out more about her passion and vision as an artist.</p>

                      		<div class="span3 pull-right"><img src="images/featured/stefanie-hauger-2.jpg" alt="Inspired by: Stefanie Hauger" /><br /><br /></div>
                            
                            <h5>Q: Art is a demanding profession. What motivates you as a full-time artist?</h5>
                            <p>A: Creation and curiosity motivate me. It is the thrill of making something that has not been done before and discovering what I can do within the realm of art. It was the same when I was a designer. I was always looking to break molds and to do something fresh and new. I never wanted to be a traditional painter.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Q: Your techniques are definitely anything but traditional. How do you develop them?</h5>
                            <p>A: They evolve organically. I am constantly thinking of new ways to manipulate the paint, or the medium with which I work. I spend a lot of time studying other artists and what they have done. I look at their work and I ask myself how can I do that differently? How can I push the boundaries?</p>

							<h5>Q: What directs your artistic vision?</h5>
                            <p>A: What motivated me as a designer has definitely influenced my vision in arts. As a designer, I am drawn to things which are simple and which exhibit a timeless quality. Similarly as an artist, I want to create artworks that convey balance and purity.</p>
                            <p>My brain works spatially. I think in three dimensions. When I am creating a work of art, I create it in situ. I always think of the home where the art piece would be displayed and imagine how it would fit in. This is the reason why I work with large canvases because I see them in contemporary homes with brave and bold owners.</p>

							<h5>Q: Having been a spectator to one (as your mother is an active artist in Germany) and a participant in another, do you see a difference in the art communities of Germany and Singapore?</h5>
                            <p>A: My mother lived in a small town in Germany where she had a captive audience. The local scene in terms of contemporary art is still evolving, so I think it is harder to be understood as a contemporary artist in Singapore. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Q: How has your life changed after winning the UOB Southeast Asian and Singapore Painting of the Year Awards?</h5>
                            <p>A: Winning the awards has changed the way that I work as an artist. The awards are a massive validation of my art. They have given me the confidence and the courage to be bold and creative in my artworks.</p>
                            <p>Winning took me from being a little-known artist to a recognised name within the local art community. It has given me access to people that I did not have access to before. It has also enabled me to approach galleries on a totally different platform. I am starting to work with a gallery in Sydney and another one here in Singapore. </p>
							<p>People stop and take notice of my works now because of the awards. The whole UOB Painting of the Year experience has been absolutely amazing! </p>

                            <h2>New Horizons</h2>
                            <p>A solo exhibition by Stefanie Hauger<br /><span class="italic">24 June 2014 to 11 August 2014, UOB Plaza 1, 80 Raffles Place, Singapore 048624</span></p>
                            <p><span class="italic">New Horizons</span> consists of two series - <span class="italic">&lsquo;Mandalas&rsquo;</span> and <span class="italic">&lsquo;Moments&rsquo;</span> - described by Ms Stefanie Hauger as the yin and yang of her work. The <span class="italic">&lsquo;Mandalas&rsquo;</span> series consists of serene and controlled images which draw you in. In contrast, the <span class="italic">&lsquo;Moments&rsquo;</span> series are edgy, dynamic and complex. Together, they show Ms Hauger&rsquo;s desire to explore diverse imagery and techniques, and push the boundaries of creativity.</p>
                            <p>Ms Hauger is no stranger to pushing personal boundaries. In 2011, she stepped away from her lifestyle business Vanilla Home to become a full-time contemporary artist. New Horizons, in many ways, represents a new beginning in Ms Hauger&rsquo;s journey as an artist.</p>
                            <p><span class="italic">New Horizons</span> is part of a series of exhibitions at the UOB Art Gallery that will feature the latest collections by the UOB Painting of the Year alumni.</p>

                        <h4>UOB Painting of the Year Award and Southeast Asian Painting of the Year Award - Singapore</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">Space Odyssey</span><br/>Stefanie Hauger, (b.1969, Germany)<br /><br />Acrylic on Canvas<br/>170.0 x 170.0 cm</p>
                        <p>Ms Hauger’s contemporary interpretation of a mandala, a concentric circular diagram which helps focus attention during meditation, shows an abstract representation of a healthy planet as seen from space. By meditating on the health of the planet, the artist hopes that the viewer’s subconscious becomes invigorated by the fresh cool colours and the absence of heat. Ms Hauger says that our current planet is being destroyed and she hopes that her interpretation of a healthy planet will instill in the audience a desire to care for the planet and repair the damage being done.</p>
                        <p>From a young age, Ms Hauger has spent been immersed in the world of art and design. Her mother was a successful photographer and painter and Ms Hauger spent her childhood accompanying her mother to art exhibitions. Her father was an avid collector of art and antiques and she has a sister who is currently a Doctor of Art History. Following her training in interior architecture in the UK, Ms Hauger arrived in Singapore at the age of 24. After a long career in interior design, Ms Hauger decided to pursue her dreams and became a full-time artist in 2011.</p>

                        <h4>UOB Painting of the Year Award (Established Artist) - Thailand</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">Hope on the Ruins No.3</span><br/>Mr. Aphiphol Techamangkhalanon, 23 years old<br /><br />Acrylic Painting<br/>175.0 x 140.0 cm</p>
                        <p>The city in Hope on the Ruins No.3 lies devoid of life in the darkness. Repelling the gloom, is a traditional shrine that glimmers like a beacon and casts its pale glow over rooftops. Mr. Aphiphol uses a spare palette to create the shadows and light in this atmospheric painting. The contrasting white and black reflect his belief that virtue and morality will triumph over materialism. To the artist, modernisation and technology have brought the ills of materialism to the city, casting a shadow over it and driving its inhabitants away. The shrine shimmering from within the darkness symbolises his belief in society’s virtue and its ability to withstand the test of time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Aphiphol is a final year student from the faculty of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts at the Silpakorn University. He has won many awards including the Excellent Award from the 3rd Asia Plus Art Exhibition and the 2nd Honorable Prize of Silpa Bhirasir from the 30th Exhibition of Contemporary Art by Young Artist.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Old Man</span><br/>Mr. Gan Tee Sheng, (b. 1984)<br /><br />Oil on Canvas<br/>167.5 x 133.5cm</p>
                        <p>The painting depicts an old man resting by the side of the road. The tired expression reflects the old man’s loneliness and helplessness, knowing his life is coming to an end. The background and objects were blurred to express the emptiness in the old man’s mind in his state of anxiety. Through the painting, Mr. Gan wants to remind the society to give more care and attention to the elderly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gan Tee Sheng has been involved in a few exhibitions, including the Young &amp; News Part III Exhibition at Matahari Gallery in 2009, Artriangle III at National Art Gallery in 2010, the Garden of Hidden Desires at Wei-ling Gallery in 2011, and the Figurative Trajectories at G13 Gallery in 2013.</p>

                        <p>The painting portrays an artist in his studio, where love and romance is in the air and fantasy and reality are intertwined. It is in his studio that Mr Suroso explores his idealism and the concept of beauty in both its modern and traditional form. The man in the painting with a cloth covering the face depicts the artist himself. Faced with paradoxical ideals and concepts, the artist finds himself locked up in isolation.</p>

                        <h4>Gold Award (Established Artist) - Singapore</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">Digital Vertigo</span><br/>Lester Lee Ngai Sing, (b.1964, Singapore)<br /><br />Mixed Media on Canvas<br/>180.0 x 165.0 cm</p>
                        <p>According to Mr Lee, children today are increasingly reliant on technology. The way they learn, play and communicate is changing and Mr Lee asks us through his painting if the high exposure to electronic media is a good thing. This work reflects Mr Lee’s experience of raising two children and illustrates his concerns with the impact of technology on a developing child.</p>
                        <p>Mr Lee studied under distinguished Singapore water-colourists Mr Ong Kim Seng and Mr Peh Eng Seng in the late 1980s. During this time, he received an art award from the Ministry of Communication and Information in 1989. This recognition spurred him on to improve his craft at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and eventually led to a 10-year stint in the US where he developed his love for multi-disciplinary art forms including sculptures. He currently holds a Master of Art (Contemporary Practice) from the University of Huddersfield, UK. Mr Lee received a Highly Commended award at the 30th UOB Painting of the Year competition.</p>

                        <p>There is a saying by Buddhism Master Qing Yuan Wei Xin &ldquo;见山不是山&rdquo; (the mountain you see is not a mountain), which explains the difference between what the eyes see and physical reality. In this painting, Mr Tan questions the fate of the new generation. The Chinese character &ldquo;山&rdquo; (mountain) is a representation of the obstacles that the child in the painting will face later in life.</p>
                        <p>Mr Tan has been in Singapore for more than 20 years and is currently the editor of Yuan Magazine, the Chinese culture publication by the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations. He also teaches art appreciation part-time at Singapore Institute of Management University. Mr Tan holds a Master of Arts in Translation Studies from Beijing Normal University and a Diploma in Arts from Guizhou Art School. Mr Tan previously received the Highly Commended award at the 19th UOB Painting of the Year competition.</p>

                        <p>This still life painting of an open pomegranate wrapped in a crinkled plastic sheet is an observation of the myopic views of identity and citizenship within Singapore society. The plastic covering signifies the artificial nature of nation building activities. Ms Tan has left part of the painting unfinished to depict the young nation’s ongoing development, while the dark mass of seeds represents the issues that threaten its security. The deformed animal head in the centre of the painting illustrates the emergence of new perspectives and differing views.</p>
                        <p>Trained as a teacher, Ms Tan decided to follow her dreams and became a professional artist in 2010. Selling her first work that year emboldened her to develop her craft and she has continued to sell her works to galleries and individual collectors. Ms Tan currently marries her skills as an educator with her love of art by teaching art classes. She is also a member of the International Guild of Realism and the Portrait Society of America.</p>

                        <p>In <span class="italic">The Transcendence of Love,</span> a father’s love shines through the seemingly quiet and dull atmosphere of a public train. The boy sleeps with his head resting on his father’s lap. The father, gazing at his son with affection and care, occasionally caresses the boy’s head. Mr Lim uses his painting to take a critical look at the world around him, yet shares the quiet beauty of a private moment to inspire a sense of warmth.</p>
                        <p>Mr Lim received a Gold with Honours award at the Singapore Youth Festival 2012 Central Judging for Art and Crafts. He is currently pursuing an International Baccalaureate Diploma at the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in Singapore.</p>

                        <p>This piece of artwork demonstrates the power of paint outside a gallery. Paint splashes and graffiti are common marks left by loan sharks on the properties of debtors who may be late in making payments. They are marks of shame and irresponsibility. They also reflect the helplessness of the debtors and their families. With daring strokes and colours, Ms Lim expresses the sense of isolation these families face from the lack of social sympathy.</p>
                        <p>Ms Lim started painting with watercolours and oil pastels at the age of 10. One of the winners at the 2013 Orchard Gateway Art Competition, she is currently pursuing a degree in Fine Art from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, after graduating with a Diploma in Fine Art in 2005. She is also interested in sculpture and photography.</p>

                        <p>The triptych depicts three different fallen leaves that have been conjoined together to form a whole. Through <span class="italic">Silent Life,</span> Ms Ong emphasises that the beauty of nature not only resides in the living but can also be found in the dead. The photorealistic style of the artwork opens the eyes to the delicate work of Mother Nature, while the monochromatic scheme of the artwork underlines the natural cycles that exist as a backdrop to the urban hustle and bustle.</p>

                        <p>The daily turmoil from a life that is too fast, too rushed and too messy can lead to a feeling of suffocation. Against this, Ms Ang seeks to capture the moment when one uses their last ounce of strength to break free from turmoil and reach a goal. Using the raw and unfinished quality of the medium, Ms Ang’s artwork emphasises the vitality of the human spirit and strength over the surrounding turmoil.</p>
                        <p>Ms Ang recently completed her GCE O-Level examinations at the Nanyang Girls High School in Singapore, where she was enrolled in the Art Elective Programme. Soon, she will be continuing her studies at the Hwa Chong Institution. Ms Ang has a deep interest in the fine arts and dance, both of which came together to inspire this work.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">The Impression Of Singapore Series - Three, Colour Space</span><br/>Gong Yao Min, (b.1964, China)<br /><br />Chinese Ink and Colour on Paper<br/>182.5 x 182.0 cm</p>
                        <p>Mr Gong's impression of Singapore is that of a dense and compact city with pockets of sparkling light and space. His work synthesises the aesthetics of Western stained glass panels with their distinctive coloured illumination, and the versatility and fluidity of Chinese ink brushwork. The artist creates visual rhythms through alternating solid ink strokes with delicate patterning. Looking through his glass windows one can gaze at the city's old colonial architecture. The painting is a re-energising take on the <span class="italic">shanshui</span>(mountain/water) tradition in Chinese ink painting.</p>
                        <p>Memorably saying that the prize money won from the UOB Painting of the Year competition bought him 'time', Mr Gong is now a professional artist. He is a graduate of the An Hui Educational University in China and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore.</p>

                        <p>Mr Gong brings his dream city into sharp focus in this painting which won him his second UOB Painting of the Year Award. The work is inspired by the artist's impressions of Singapore. Having lived in the city for more than a decade, he wanted to capture its beauty and prosperity through its architecture. The artist reveals the city's multiple facets in exquisite detail. Older iconic buildings that speak of Singapore's rich culture and history meld with the modern skyscrapers of this Asian financial centre.</p>
                        <p>Memorably saying that the prize money won from the UOB Painting of the Year competition bought him 'time', Mr Gong is now a professional artist. He is a graduate of the An Hui Educational University in China and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore.</p>

                        <h4>1997 UOB Painting Of the Year - Singapore</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">Endless Love</span><br/>Kit Tan Juat Lee, (b.1955, Singapore)<br /><br />Oil on Canvas<br />145.5 x 115.3 cm</p>
                        <p><span class="italic">Endless Love</span> is a visual treasure-trove of the artist's memories of her mother and exudes warmth and optimism. Ms Tan paints the emblems of her childhood - the manual Singer sewing machine with its Chinese-doll pin-cushion, the paper bola (Malay for ball) and her mother's patchwork quilt. The vintage sepia photographs on the wall capture important childhood memories and milestones. These objects, largely phased out in contemporary life, embody security, and joyfulness. Ms Tan's memories are far from faded and are recorded with precision and vividness. The painting dares the viewer to come closer to explore its colours and textures until finally the rewards present themselves in exquisite detail.</p>
						<p>Ms Tan was a former educator in Chinese heritage and culture and a graduate of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and Nanyang University, both in Singapore. Currently a professional artist, her interest in contemporary Asian identities has evolved alongside a signature style of immaculate painting, vivid colours and graphic sensibilities.</p>

                        <h4>2004 UOB Painting Of the Year - Singapore</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">The World Of Xi You Ji</span><br/>Kit Tan Juat Lee, (b.1955, Singapore)<br /><br />Oil on Canvas<br/>144.0 x 175.0 cm</p>
                        <p>This festive class portrait delivers an imaginative twist to a traditional story. It is inspired by the adventures of the Monkey God in the legendary <span class="italic">Xi You Ji</span> (Journey to the West), one of the four great classics of Chinese literature.</p>
                        <p>The teacher and students are depicted in the black and white of vintage photographs. It is the colourful masks that take centre stage. They animate their wearers who take on the mischievous behaviour of the Monkey God. The work suggests that classics such as Xi You Ji have a life of their own and will endure and outlive those who study them.</p>
                        <p>Ms Tan won her second UOB Painting of the Year Award with The World Of Xi You Ji. She is a former educator in Chinese heritage and culture and a graduate of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore. Currently a professional artist, her interest in contemporary Asian identities has evolved alongside a signature style of immaculate painting, vivid colours and graphic sensibilities.</p>

                        <p><span class="italic">The Dune</span> alludes to a special moment in the artist's life when he was a student in the US under the mentorship of collage master Leo Manso. Mr Goh lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts – famous for its windswept sand dunes and beaches which have been captured in The Dune. The work also asserts its Asian identity through Chinese ink brush work.</p>
                        <p>Mr Goh, a Singapore Cultural Medallion recipient in 1989, was mentored by late pioneer artist Mr Chen Wen Hsi before his overseas art studies at the Art Students League, New York in 1962 and the Provincetown Workshop, Massachusetts in 1964. The Ford Foundation Scholarship was among the numerous accolades he received for his work. He was among a select group of artists returning from overseas studies who advocated abstraction and among the first to incorporate materials such as sand and rope into his collage paintings.</p>

                        <p><span class="italic">Waves</span> is part of an innovative series for which the late Anthony Poon is best known. He was unquestionably Singapore's leading proponent of Geometric Abstraction. His paintings, exemplified by Waves, typically carried colours and forms of extreme simplicity and featured paint application and finishing that was precise and immaculate.</p>
                        <p>Mr Poon was a graduate of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore and the Bynam-Shaw School of Art in London. He was part of a group of artists who studied art overseas during the 1960s and then returned home advocating Abstract principles. By the 1990s he had become a central figure in corporate commissions for sculptures and paintings in public spaces. Mr Poon was conferred the prestigious Cultural Medallion in 1990, Singapore's highest award for those achieving artistic excellence.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">My Haunt</span><br/>Chua Ek Kay, (b.1947 China - 2008)<br /><br />Chinese Ink and Colour on Paper<br/>199.5 x 113.7 cm</p>
                        <p><span class="italic">My Haunt</span> stands out as a significant contemporary Chinese ink painting for its simplicity of form and decisiveness of brushwork. A combination of emphatic, powerful strokes and feathery, sensitive ones in a single dominant colour produce a spectrum of visual rhythms. The artist's favourite haunts were the back-alleys of old Chinatown shophouses that he loved to paint. This interest evolved into the Street Scenes series for which he is well remembered.</p>
                        <p>The late Mr Chua was a 1999 Singapore Cultural Medallion recipient and his work is celebrated for re-energising the ink tradition. Mentored by the late Mr Fang Chang Tien in the xieyi expressive school, Mr Chua later pursued studies at Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts in Singapore, and the University of Tasmania and the University of Western Sydney, both in Australia. He integrated various philosophies of aesthetics into his work, sometimes including post-modern theories in his artistic practice.</p>

                        <p>In these modern times, education, science and knowledge have become an absolute necessity for every human being. <span class="italic">Himne Sekolah</span> or <span class="italic">School Hymns</span> makes a strong statement about the importance of schools in fulfilling this human need and advocates for greater care and attention to be paid to schools and the education system.</p>
                        <p>The painting depicts a pianist and a choir trying to create harmony in an environment that seems unorganised. With this work, Mr Y. Indra says he wants to encourage society to voice out openly the problems that exist in education and to work together to solve them. In his vision, different voices come together to create a single song of beauty that for him represents the ultimate destination for a nation.</p>
                        <p>Mr Y. Indra studied fine arts at the Institut Seni Indonesia, Yogyakarta. He continues to hold solo exhibitions and has won art awards in Indonesia.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Ah Long</span><br/>Mohd Azri bin Abdullah, (b.1978, Malaysia)<br /><br />Charcoal with Bitumen<br/>134.6 x 147.3cm</p>
                        <p>Mr Mohd Azri shines a light on the shadowy world of illegal money lending and the people who run it, known as <span class="italic">ah long</span> in Malaysia. The illegal money lending trade used to be covert and conducted by word-of-mouth, but now ah longs no longer operate "under the table". In the artist's opinion, they have surfaced their operations such that their presence can be felt almost everywhere. Their posters and "promotional materials" are all over the place including scribbled on tables in public places.</p>
                        <p>The back alleys of the urban, modern city of Kuala Lumpur are usually where the <span class="italic">ah longs</span> conduct their business. The depiction of the <span class="italic">ah long</span> as a shadow is both a literal and figurative reflection. Once the borrower is in the ah long's books, there is no escaping his clutches – he will be a constant shadow dogging the borrower's every moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr Mohd Azri graduated with a Diploma in Fine Art from the Malaysia Institute of Art. He paints part-time and has participated in several local art exhibitions. Following his win in the 2012 UOB Malaysia Painting of the Year competition, he has caught the eye of several art galleries and is currently working towards becoming a full-time artist.</p>

                        <h4>2012 UOB Painting Of the Year - Thailand</h4>
                        <p><span class="bold">Faith</span><br/>Aimrom Yunu, (b.1984 Thailand)<br /><br />Acrylic On Canvas<br/>161.0 x 136.0 cm</p>
                        <p>Mr Yunu touches hearts with a magnificent portrait of his beloved grandmother which expresses the strong religious values and belief in goodness that she imparted to him as a child.</p>
                        <p>To the artist, the world today is materialistic - full of competition, struggles and a desire for power and fortune. He feels that it is through religion that people learn to be good, decent and refrain from doing injustice to others. A Muslim who prays five times a day, Mr Yunu wrote his prayer repeatedly onto his painting with each prayer session to remind himself to do good deeds. "By praying five times each day, we gain an audience with God in a calm and self-controlled manner," he says. This allows the mind to be cleansed, serene and content with a clear conscience in life.</p>
                        <p>Mr Yunu is pursuing a Masters degree in Fine Art at Silpakorn University, Thailand.</p>
